#  Wordpress Plugin: Standalone Frontend Site Url Extension
This plugin replaces in several links the Home Url with the Site Url. When only the Wordpress REST API is used by a standalone frontend service, e.g. links for assets and feeds have to be the Wordpress Url, while links to rendered posts have to use the frontend service Url.
